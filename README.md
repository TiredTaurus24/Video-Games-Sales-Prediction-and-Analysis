# Video Game Sales Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of video game sales to provide insights into various aspects of the gaming industry, including regional sales distribution, top-selling genres, and genre sales over time. It utilizes Apache Spark for data processing and Scala as the programming language.
Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a CSV file containing information about video game sales, including attributes such as Rank, Name, Platform, Year, Genre, Publisher, and sales data for different regions (NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales, Global_Sales). The dataset allows for comprehensive analysis of video game sales trends and patterns.

## Analysis

* Top 10 best selling games

* Sales distribution by genre

* Sales distribution by year

* Publisher with the highest sales

* Platform distribution

* Year with the highest sale

* Top 5 publishers

* Genre distributions

* Most sold genre by year

* Games released per year

* Number of games published by publishers 

## Usage

* Set up the Spark environment and import the necessary libraries.

* Load the video game sales dataset into an RDD or DataFrame.

* Utilize the provided code snippets to perform different analyses, such as regional sales distribution, top-selling genres, and genre sales over time.

* Adjust the code as needed to customize the analysis or apply additional operations on the data.

* Execute the code and observe the output to gain insights into the video game sales dataset.
    
* Here, we are using 2 datasets, one for analysis and one for the random forest, both have the same contents but its just formatted accordingly to the analysis and to the random forest model which we did
